#### _What have I done earlier?_

I've worked like environmental engineer in different directions.
I did environmental education, environmental engineering surveys 
and purification of soils and groundwater from oil products.
I've done field work in difficult northern conditions and cameral work.

#### _Why did I decide to go in IT?_

It's important for me to be a part of technological progress.
I think technological progress can help to decide accumulated
problems of the modern world, including environmental ones.

#### _Where did I learn programming?_

1. [_Sololearn_](https://www.sololearn.com/home). This is popular place for self-study of various
programming languages. In each course, I've learned basic functions and features of the language, 
and then used them in practice.If I didn’t have enough materials, or some topics were not very clear,
I turned to numerous Internet resources and YouTube, and of course books.
